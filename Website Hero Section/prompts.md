## Prompt 1

Your task is to create HTML and CSS for the hoverChair website's "hero" section. HoverChair is a hover-craft inspired desk chair that floats slightly above the ground, providing a comfortable and exciting seating experience.

The hero section should include a main heading, subheading, short description paragraph , and a call to action link styled as a button.

Consider the following guidelines for the code :

- Ensure the code is easy to understand for the non-coders by avoiding the use of comples CSS layout
- Use an elegant and nuetral color pallete, with a focus on earthy tones and subdued hues.
- Document each CSS property you use with a short code comment to explain its purpose.

Your Final result should be an engaging and visually appealing hero section that effectively showcases the HoverChair brand.

## Prompt 2

Update the HTML and CSS by adding a small, rounded image named 'chair.png' above the hero heading. Add a soft shadow behind the image.
